  BUG FIXES

    PIG-918. Fix infinite loop only columns in first column group are
    specified. (Yan Zhou via rangadi)
 
    PIG-949. If an entire map is placed in non default column group, 
    and a specific key placed in another CG, the second CG did not 
    work as expected. (Yan Zhou, Jing Huang (tests) via rangadi)
